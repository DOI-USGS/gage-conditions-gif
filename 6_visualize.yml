  # here we'll generate the components for basemap, focus_geoms, secondary_geoms,
  # adn storm_line. each of these components doesn't change over time. each
  # component is a closure, i.e., a function that contains all the data it needs
  # to run. the closure should accept 0 arguments. the closure should be saved
  # into an RDS file with a corresponding .rds.ind indicator file.

  # right here we will create and run a task table that will be responsible for generating
  # the components, e.g., '5_vizprep/out/storm_point_20170926_11.rds.ind' through
  # '5_vizprep/out/streamdata_20170926_11.rds.ind', one per column=step. and then the final
  # column=step of that task table will be to run create_storm_frame on the output of all the other
  # steps in that row=task=timestep.

  # here's an example of the a single task-step for that last column=step of the task table:
